README for the BE521 Project
============================

The aim of the project is to make models (get weights, parameters for 
models) so that a final prediction on the testing set can be done.

The docorrelation file (with variable cv=1) needs to be run to check 
if the models give a good cross validation error or not. With cv=2, 
the docorrelation file will save the final models which finalrun.m 
file takes to make prediction on the test_data.
